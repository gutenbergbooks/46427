<p>The selections contained in this book make up a sequence
which records the history of the Great War from the stirring
days of August, 1914, to the opening of the Peace Conference
in January, 1919. These selections of verse and prose
are arranged, not necessarily in chronological order, but still
with a view to indicate approximately the historic succession
of great events and the varying moods of those authors and
speakers who have been the voices of the allied nations during
the fifty-two months of warfare.</p>

<p>Although this anthology has been prepared for the use
of schools, the plan of selection and arrangement has made it
impracticable to grade the poems and extracts to suit the
capacities of pupils of different ages. The judgment of the
teacher must determine what is suitable for one grade and
what for another. Many of the poems and some of the prose
extracts will be found too difficult for young pupils.</p>

<p>Due acknowledgments have been made throughout the
book to the authors and publishers who have generously made
it possible to bring together so valuable a collection of the
literature of the War. The meed of gratitude due to all the
writers represented here can never be adequately paid.
Special mention is made of Nizamat Jung, Native Judge of
the High Court of Hyderabad, who has given expression to
the wonderful loyalty of the races of teeming India, which
have poured out treasure and blood without stint in defence
of their Emperor-King.</p>

<p><i>A sufficient number of copies of this book should be kept
in all school libraries; and it is suggested that the poems
and prose extracts should be used in the reading classes, as
often as is expedient, instead of the authorized Readers.</i></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The boys and girls of this generation have had the
opportunity and responsibility of living through great
times. In days to come they will look back with a
feeling akin to awe on the hours when, in Sir Owen
Seaman's words, they "saw the Powers of Darkness
put to flight" and "saw the morning break." The
future of our country will be determined by the youth
of to-day. Problems of the greatest complexity and
perplexity await solution, and can be solved only by
honesty, intelligence, sympathy, breadth of outlook,
sacrificial service, and the fear of God. The teachers
and pupils now in our schools are in the midst of a
great crisis, and will need greatness of soul that they
may rightly face it. That they will respond nobly to
the challenge of the age, I have not the shadow of a
doubt.</p>

<p>Never was there a more timely occasion for the
teaching of an ardent and enlightened patriotism.
Those who understand the issues at stake in the Great
War, the genius of the world-wide British Commonwealth,
the national consciousness of our own fair
Canada, the lessons taught us by the mighty struggle,
will be well-instructed citizens of this Dominion,
equipped by knowledge and by spirit to serve their
country, their Empire, and the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>The selections of Verse and Prose in this book set
forth the varying and successive phases of the War,
and seek to remind, to inform, and to inspire. The
teachers will use them as vehicles of moral and
patriotic instruction. The pupils will keep them forever
in their hearts and minds. Surely if we wish to
introduce any good element into the life of a nation, it
can best be introduced through its schools and colleges.</p>

<p>It is well to recall the issues that have been
decided; for in no struggle have greater hung in the
balance. The crime perpetrated against the Belgians,
aggravated by its accompanying treachery and
brutality and immediately followed by unparalleled
sanguinary atrocity, revealed as by a lurid flash the
nature and the greatness of the menace to which
Christian civilization was exposed. Prussian militarism,
in this belated, almost incredible but all too
terrible, outbreak of Pagan barbarism, threatened to
overthrow all the best elements in international life.</p>

<p>(1) The very idea of a Commonwealth of Europe,
the growing sense of solidarity, the recognition of
general interests, the existence of international institutions
such as the Hague Tribunal&mdash;were seen to be
doomed, if Germany should come forth a victor.</p>

<p>(2) The law of international good faith,&mdash;the absolutely
indispensable foundation for any international
fabric,&mdash;would be abolished, if a single criminal state
could defy it with impunity, and could profitably disregard
treaties, oaths, Geneva Conventions, Hague
Declarations, if these interfered with its own selfish
advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) The fate of the smaller States of Europe, with
their own special contributions to civilization, would
be sealed, if the arrogant <i>Kultur</i> of Germany were
forced upon a subjugated world.</p>

<p>(4) The principle of nationality, vital to a stable
and organic modern state, would be crushed or remain
as a source of constant unrest in Austro-Hungary, in
the Balkan Peninsula, and in other disturbed parts of
Europe.</p>

<p>(5) Democracy, with all it implies of self-government,
freedom from external compulsion, peaceful
development, and civic progress, was recognized as
having come to deathgrips with its ancient foe&mdash;militaristic
autocracy.</p>

<p>(6) The future development of all the Free States
of the world, the Entente Powers and the neutrals,
was threatened by the German blow for world-power.
The very existence of the British Empire as a free,
prosperous, and progressive commonwealth, was imperilled.
The freedom of our own Dominion was
assailed.</p>

<p>(7) Behind all political and material interests,
profound moral issues were at stake. The struggle was
against the "armed doctrine,"&mdash;that diabolical perversion
of all sound political thinking,&mdash;that the
essence of the State is might, that the State is above
all moral restraints, that war is its normal and
noblest activity, and that war may be waged with
pitiless ferocity and scientific frightfulness.</p>

<p>All the forces that opposed freedom, self-government,
and progress gathered around the despotisms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
Central Europe. In 1914 they made their bid for world
dominion. Never before had so much been at stake;
perhaps never again will such issues be put to the test.
Thank God, the judgment has been given; the righteous
government of the world has been vindicated; Right
has triumphed over Might.</p>

<p>Gradually the real nature of the struggle was
recognized by the free peoples of the world. Their
sons felt they were summoned to a new crusade. They
went forth as champions of democracy against
autocracy, of freedom against tyranny, of mercy
against ruthlessness, of justice against iniquity, of
decency against shamefulness, of good faith against
perfidy, of Right against Might, of peace against war,
of humane and Christian civilization against savage
and pagan barbarism. All the world was presently
forced to give a moral and political judgment on the
issues.</p>

<p>Our own glorious British Empire, with its traditions
of justice, honour, and liberty, soon became the
soul and centre of the Allied resistance. By her Fleet,
by her Armies, by her aircraft, by her financing, by
her supplies, by her indomitable spirit&mdash;she endured
and smote the foe. We pay grateful tribute to the
achievements of all our Allies in the common cause;
but we do not forget Britain's mighty burden.</p>

<p>Among the British Armies, no troops have won
higher distinction than the Canadian Corps, under
their great leader, Sir Arthur Currie. They were
ranked among the most formidable fighting units on the
Western Front, and as an offensive spear-head of shock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
troops they were unsurpassed. They fought in almost
every critical engagement of the War. They "saved
the day" at the second Battle of Ypres, in face of the
hideous emission of poison gas; they fought in the
long-drawn agony of the Somme; they won Vimy
Ridge, Hill 70, and Passchendaele in 1917; they were
in the thickest of the battle in the last "hundred
days", as they fought triumphantly at Amiens, Arras,
Cambrai, Valenciennes, and Mons. The last blow
struck before the Armistice was signed, was struck
by the Canadians, who entered Mons early on the
morning of the eleventh of November. The course of
the war for the British Armies on the Western Front
was <i>from Mons</i>, where the "Old Contemptibles" were
flung into the furnace of the fight in August, 1914,
<i>to Mons</i>, won by our men from overseas in November,
1918. It was "a long, long way", a way stained
by blood and sweat, but at last the grim journey ended.
Canada has made a worthy contribution to world-freedom
and world-brotherhood.</p>

<p>Canada is dearer to us than ever, because it has
been purchased anew at a great cost of precious blood.
Those who have fallen are worthy of everlasting
remembrance. They will be commemorated by public
monuments, by tablets of bronze, or brass or marble in
public buildings, by "storied windows richly dight".
They deserve this. But, before God, they deserve at
our hands a better monument&mdash;even the monument of
a purer, nobler Canada, more intelligent, more united,
more sober, more kindly, more God-fearing. Dying for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
Canada, they have recreated Canada. Let us be
worthy of those whose deaths have kept us free.</p>

<p>Through the experiences of these recent years, we
have learned the possibilities of heroism latent in every
man. We need not hesitate to make high demands on
our citizens for worthy ends. We have regained a
right sense of the relative value of things, and we
know that the first things are those which are ideal,
spiritual, eternal. We know that persons are of infinitely
more value than things; that the development
and enrichment of personality mark the only true
advance in civilization; and that the basis of national
progress is the health, efficiency, and spiritual well-being
of the people. We have realized the power of
organized effort. We shall not forget the bonds of
sympathy which common sorrows have created. We
have gained a wider outlook on the world and a truer
conception of the meaning of Empire. We understand
more clearly the national problems that lie before us
in this new era. A better Canada will not come of
itself. It must be planned for and striven for. But it
will come, if there is kindled in the souls of our citizens
the same flame of sacrifice and service which burned
so brightly in the hearts of Canada's citizen-soldiers of
the Great War.</p>

<h2>LORD KITCHENER'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE<br />
BRITISH SOLDIER</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>August, 1914</i>)</p>


<p>You are ordered abroad as a soldier of the King
to help our French comrades against the invasion of
a common enemy. You have to perform a task which
will need your courage, your energy, your patience.
Remember that the honour of the British Army
depends on your individual conduct.</p>

<p>It will be your duty, not only to set an example
of discipline and perfect steadiness under fire, but
also to maintain the most friendly relations with those
whom you are helping in this struggle. The operations
in which you are engaged will, for the most part,
take place in a friendly country, and you can do your
own country no better service than in showing yourself
in France and Belgium in the true character of a
British soldier.</p>

<p>Be invariably courteous, considerate, and kind.
Never do anything likely to injure or destroy property,
and always look upon looting as a disgraceful act.
You are sure to meet with a welcome and to be trusted;
your conduct must justify that welcome and that trust.</p>

<p>Your duty cannot be done unless your health is
sound. So keep constantly on your guard against any
excesses. In this new experience you may find temptations
both in wine and women. You must entirely
resist both temptations, and, while treating all women
with perfect courtesy, you should avoid any intimacy.</p>

<p>Do your duty bravely. Fear God. Honour the
King.</p>

<h2>STATEMENT BY LORD KITCHENER</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>House of Lords, August 25, 1914</i>)</p>


<p>My Lords, as this is the first time I have had the
honour of addressing your Lordships, I must ask for
the indulgence of the House. In the first place, I
desire to make a personal statement. Noble Lords on
both sides of the House doubtless know that while
associating myself in the fullest degree for the prosecution
of the war with my colleagues in His Majesty's
Government, my position on this bench does not in any
way imply that I belong to any political party, for,
as a soldier, I have no politics. Another point is that
my occupation of the post of Secretary of State for
War is a temporary one. The terms of my service are
the same as those under which some of the finest portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of our manhood, now so willingly stepping forward
to join the colours, are engaging&mdash;that is to say,
for the war, or, if it lasts longer than three years, then
for three years. It has been asked why this latter
limit has been fixed. It is because that should this
disastrous war be prolonged&mdash;and no one can foretell
with any certainty its duration&mdash;then after three
years' war there will be others fresh and fully prepared
to take our places and see this matter through.</p>

<p>The very serious conflict in which we are now
engaged on the Continent has been none of our seeking.
It will undoubtedly strain the resources of our
Empire and entail considerable sacrifices on our
people. These will be willingly borne for our honour
and for the preservation of our position in the world;
and they will be shared by our Dominions beyond the
seas, now sending contingents and assistance of every
kind to help the Mother Country in this struggle. If
I am unable, owing to military considerations for the
best interests of the Allied Armies in the field, to speak
with much detail on the present situation of our Army
on the Continent, I am sure your Lordships will
pardon me for the necessary restraint which is imposed
upon me.</p>

<p>The Expeditionary Force has taken the field on
the French North-West frontier, and advanced to the
neighbourhood of Mons in Belgium. Our troops have
already been for thirty-six hours in contact with a
superior force of German invaders. During that time
they have maintained the traditions of British soldiers,
and have behaved with the utmost gallantry.</p>

<h2>A CALL TO ARMS</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>At the Guildhall, London, September 4, 1914</i>)</p>


<p>The issue has passed out of the domain of argument
into another field. But let me ask you, and through
you the world outside, what would have been our condition
to-day, if through timidity, or through a perverted
calculation of self-interest, or through a paralysis
of the sense of honour and duty, we had been
base enough to be false to our word and faithless
to our friends? Our eyes would have been turned
at this moment, with those of the whole civilized world,
to Belgium, a small State which has lived for more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
than seventy years under a several and collective
guarantee to which we, in common with Prussia and
Austria, were parties. We should have seen, at the
instance and by the action of two of those guaranteeing
Powers, her neutrality violated, her independence
strangled, her territory made use of as affording
the easiest and most convenient road to a war of
unprovoked aggression against France. We, the British
people, should at this moment be standing by, with
folded arms and with such countenance as we could
command, while this small and unprotected State, in
defence of her vital liberties, made a heroic stand
against overweening and overwhelming force. We
should have been admiring as detached spectators the
siege of Liège, the steady and manful resistance of a
small army, the occupation of Brussels with all its
splendid traditions and memories, the gradual forcing
back of the patriotic defenders of their fatherland to
the ramparts of Antwerp, countless outrages suffered
by them, buccaneering levies exacted from the unoffending
civil population, and, finally, the greatest
crime committed against civilization and culture since
the Thirty Years' War, the sack of Louvain, with its
buildings, its pictures, its unique library, its unrivalled
associations, a shameless holocaust of irreparable
treasures, lit up by blind barbarian vengeance. What
account could we, the Government and the people
of this country, have been able to render to the tribunal
of our national conscience and sense of honour, if, in
defiance of our plighted and solemn obligations, we
had endured, and had not done our best to prevent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
yes, to avenge, these intolerable wrongs? For my
part, I say that sooner than be a silent witness, which
means in effect a willing accomplice, to this tragic
triumph of force over law, and of brutality over freedom,
I would see this country of ours blotted out of
the pages of history.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>Is there any one in this hall, or in this United Kingdom,
or in the vast Empire of which we here stand in
the capital and centre, who blames us or repents our
decision? If not, as I believe there is not, we must
steel ourselves to the task, and, in the spirit which
animated our forefathers in their struggle against the
dominion of Napoleon, we must, and we shall, persevere
to the end.</p>

<p>It would be a criminal mistake to underestimate
either the magnitude, the fighting quality, or the staying
power of the forces which are arrayed against us;
but it would be equally foolish and equally indefensible
to belittle our own resources whether for resistance or
for attack. Belgium has shown us by memorable and
glorious example what can be done by a relatively
small State when its citizens are animated and fired
by the spirit of patriotism.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>Our self-governing Dominions throughout the
Empire, without any solicitation on our part, demonstrated
with a spontaneousness and unanimity unparalleled
in history their determination to affirm their
brotherhood with us, and to make our cause their own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>From Canada, from Australia, from New Zealand,
from South Africa, and from Newfoundland, the children
of the Empire assert, not as an obligation, but
as a privilege, their right and their willingness to
contribute money, material, and, what is better than
all, the strength and sinews, the fortunes and lives of
their best manhood.</p>

<p>India, too, with not less alacrity, has claimed her
share in the common task. Every class and creed,
British and native, princes and people, Hindus and
Mohammedans, vie with one another in a noble and
emulous rivalry. Two divisions of our magnificent
Indian Army are already on their way. We welcome
with appreciation and affection their proffered aid,
and, in an Empire which knows no distinction of race
or class, where all alike, as subjects of the King-Emperor,
are joint and equal custodians of our common
interest and fortunes, we here hail with profound
and heartfelt gratitude their association side by side
and shoulder to shoulder with our home and Dominion
troops, under the flag which is a symbol to all of a
unity that the world in arms cannot dissever or
dissolve.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>Never had a people more or richer sources of encouragement
and inspiration. Let us realize, first of all,
that we are fighting as a United Empire, in a cause
worthy of the highest traditions of our race. Let us
keep in mind the patient and indomitable seamen who
never relax for a moment, night or day, their stern
vigil on the lonely sea. Let us keep in mind our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
gallant troops, who to-day, after a fortnight's continuous
fighting under conditions which would try the
mettle of the best army that ever took the field, maintain
not only an undefeated but an unbroken front.</p>

<p>Finally, let us recall the memories of the great men
and the great deeds of the past, commemorated, some
of them, in the monuments which we see around us
on these walls, not forgetting the dying message of the
younger Pitt&mdash;his last public utterance, made at the
table of your predecessor, my Lord Mayor, in this very
hall: "England has saved herself by her exertions and
will, as I trust, save Europe by her example." The
England of those days gave a noble answer to his
appeal and did not sheathe the sword until, after
nearly twenty years of fighting, the freedom of Europe
was secured. Let us go and do likewise.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF<br />
RT. HON. WINSTON CHURCHILL</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>September 11, 1914</i>)</p>


<p>I was reading in the newspapers the other day
that the German Emperor made a speech to some of
his regiments in which he urged them to concentrate
their attention upon what he was pleased to call
"French's contemptible little Army". Well, they are
concentrating their attention upon it, and that Army,
which has been fighting with such extraordinary
prowess, which has revived in a fortnight of adverse
actions the ancient fame and glory of our arms upon
the Continent, and which to-night, after a long, protracted,
harassed, unbroken, and undaunted rearguard
action&mdash;the hardest trial to which troops can be
exposed&mdash;is advancing in spite of the loss of one fifth
of its numbers, and driving its enemies before it&mdash;that
Army must be reinforced and backed and supported
and increased and enlarged in numbers and in powers
by every means and every method that every one of us
can employ.</p>

<h2>"A SCRAP OF PAPER"</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>At the Queen's Hall, London, September 19, 1914</i>)</p>


<p>There is no man in this room who has always
regarded the prospect of our being engaged in a great
war with greater reluctance, with greater repugnance,
than I have done throughout the whole of my political
life. There is no man more convinced that we could
not have avoided this war without national dishonour.
I am fully alive to the fact that every nation which
has ever engaged in any war has always invoked the
sacred name of honour. Many a crime has been committed
in its name. There are some crimes being
committed now. All the same, national honour is a
reality, and any nation that disregards it is doomed.
Why is our honour as a country involved in this war?
It is because we are bound by honourable obligations
to defend the independence, the liberty, the integrity
of a small neighbour. She could not have compelled
us. She was weak. But the man who declines to discharge
his duty because his creditor is too poor to
enforce it is a blackguard.</p>

</p>

<p>What is a treaty, says the German Chancellor, but
a scrap of paper? Have you any five-pound notes
about you? Have you any of those neat little Treasury
one-pound notes? If you have, burn them. They
are only scraps of paper. What are they made of?
Rags! What are they worth? The whole credit of
the British Empire! Scraps of paper! I have been
dealing with scraps of paper in the last few weeks.
We suddenly found the commerce of the world coming
to a standstill. The machine had stopped. Why?
The machinery of commerce was moved by bills of
exchange. I have seen some of them; wretched,
crinkled, scrawled over, blotted, frowzy; and yet those
scraps of paper moved great ships, laden with thousands
of tons of precious cargo, from one end of the
world to the other. The motive power behind them
was the honour of commercial men.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is the story of the little nations. The world
owes much to little nations and to little men. This
theory of bigness&mdash;you must have a big empire and
a big nation and a big man&mdash;well, long legs have their
advantage in a retreat. Frederick the Great chose his
warriors for their height, and that tradition has
become a policy in Germany. Germany applies that
ideal to nations. She will only allow six-foot-two
nations to stand in the ranks; but all the world owes
much to the little five-foot-five nations. The greatest
art of the world was the work of little nations. The
most enduring literature of the world came from little
nations. The greatest literature of England came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from her when she was a nation of the size of Belgium
fighting a great empire. The heroic deeds that thrill
humanity through generations were the deeds of little
nations fighting for their freedom. Ah, yes, and the
salvation of mankind came through a little nation.
God has chosen little nations as the vessels by which
He carries the choicest wines to the lips of humanity,
to rejoice their hearts, to exalt their vision, to stimulate
and to strengthen their faith; and if we had stood
by when two little nations were being crushed and
broken by the brutal hands of barbarism, our shame
would have rung down through the everlasting ages.</p>

<p class='center'>

</p>

<p>The Prussian Junker is the road-hog of Europe.
Small nationalities in his way are flung to the roadside,
bleeding and broken; women and children
crushed under the wheel of his cruel car; Britain
ordered out of his way. All I can say is this: If the
old British spirit is alive in British hearts, that bully
will be torn from his seat. Were he to win it would
be the greatest catastrophe that has befallen democracy
since the days of the Holy Alliance and its
ascendency. They think we cannot beat them. It will
not be easy. It will be a long job. It will be a terrible
war. But in the end we shall march through terror
to triumph. We shall need all our qualities&mdash;every
quality that Britain and its people possess&mdash;prudence
in council, daring in action, tenacity in purpose, courage
in defeat, moderation in victory, in all things
faith, and we shall win.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is a great opportunity. It only comes once in
many centuries to the children of men. For most
generations sacrifice comes in drab weariness of spirit
to men. It has come to-day to you, it has come to-day
to us all, in the form of the glow and thrill of a great
movement for liberty, that impels millions throughout
Europe to the same noble end. It is a great war for
the emancipation of Europe from the thraldom of a
military caste, which has cast its shadow upon two
generations of men, and which has now plunged the
world into a welter of bloodshed. Some have already
given their lives. There are some who have given
more than their own lives. They have given the lives
of those who are dear to them. I honour their courage,
and may God be their comfort and their strength.
But their reward is at hand. Those who have fallen
have had consecrated deaths. They have taken their
part in the making of a new Europe, a new world. I
can see the sign of it coming in the glare of the battle-field.
The people will gain more by this struggle in
all lands than they comprehend at the present time.</p>

<p>But that is not all. There is something infinitely
greater and more enduring which is emerging already
out of this great conflict; a new patriotism, richer,
nobler, more exalted than the old one. I can see a
new recognition amongst all classes, high and low,
shedding themselves of selfishness&mdash;a new recognition
that the honour of a country does not depend merely
on the maintenance of its glory in the stricken field,
but in protecting its homes from distress as well. It
is a new patriotism. It is bringing a new outlook for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
all classes. A great flood of luxury and of sloth which
had submerged the land is receding, and a new Britain
is appearing. We can see for the first time the fundamental
things that matter in life, and that have been
obscured from our vision by the tropical growth of
prosperity.</p>

<p>May I tell you, in a simple parable, what I think
this war is doing for us? I know a valley in North
Wales, between the mountains and the sea, a beautiful
valley, snug, comfortable, sheltered by the mountains
from all the bitter blasts. It was very enervating,
and I remember how the boys were in the habit of
climbing the hills above the village to have a glimpse
of the great mountains in the distance and to be stimulated
and freshened by the breeze which came from
the hilltops, and by the great spectacle of that great
range.</p>

<p>We have been living in a sheltered valley for generations.
We have been too comfortable, too indulgent;
many, perhaps, too selfish. And the stern hand of
fate has scourged us to an elevation where we can see
the great everlasting things that matter for a nation,
the great peaks of honour we had forgotten, duty and
patriotism, and, clad in glittering white, the great
pinnacle of sacrifice pointing like a rugged finger to
Heaven. We shall descend into the valleys again; but
as long as the men and women of this generation last
they will carry in their hearts the image of these great
mountain peaks, whose foundations are unshaken,
though Europe rock and sway in the convulsions of a
great war.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF LORD KITCHENER<br />
AT THE GUILDHALL</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>November 9, 1914</i>)</p>


<p>The British Empire is now fighting for its existence.
I want every citizen to understand this cardinal fact,
for only from a clear conception of the vast importance
of the issue at stake can come the great national, moral
impulse without which Governments, War Ministers,
and even Navies and Armies can do but little. We
have enormous advantages in our resources of men
and material, and in that wonderful spirit of ours
which has never understood the meaning of defeat.
All these are great assets, but they must be used
judiciously and effectively.</p>

<p>I have no complaint whatever to make about the
response to my appeals for men&mdash;and I may mention
that the progress in the military training of those who
have already enlisted is most remarkable; the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
may well be proud of them&mdash;but I shall want more
men, and still more, till the enemy is crushed. Armies
cannot be called together as with a magician's wand,
and in the process of formation there may have been
discomfort and inconveniences and, in some cases,
even downright suffering. I cannot promise that these
conditions will wholly cease, but I can give you every
assurance that they have already greatly diminished,
and that everything which administrative energy can
do to bring them to an end will assuredly be done.
The men who come forward must remember that they
are enduring for their country's sake just as their
comrades are in the shell-torn trenches.</p>

<p>Although, of course, our thoughts are constantly
directed toward the troops at the front and the great
task they have in hand, it is well to remember that
the enemy will have to reckon with the force of the
great Dominion, the vanguard of which we have
already welcomed in the very fine body of men forming
the contingents from Canada and Newfoundland;
while from Australia, New Zealand, and other parts,
are coming in quick succession soldiers to fight for the
Imperial cause. And besides all these, there are
training in this country over a million and a quarter
of men eagerly waiting for the call to bear their part
in the great struggle, and as each and every soldier
takes his place in the field, he will stand forward to
do his duty, and in doing that duty will sustain the
credit of the British Army, which, I submit, has never
stood higher than it does to-day.</p>

<p class='center'>(<i>British House of Commons, November 11, 1914</i>)</p>


<p>The Empire is on its trial. The experience of these
three months not only encourages us to believe, but
inspires us with the confident hope that the longer the
trial lasts, and the more severe it becomes, the more
clearly shall we emerge from it the champions of a
just cause, and we shall have achieved, not only for
ourselves&mdash;for our direct and selfish interests are
small&mdash;but for Europe and for civilization, and for
the great principle of small nationalities, and for
liberty and for justice, one of their most enduring
victories.</p>

<h2>"CANADIANS&mdash;CANADIANS&mdash;THAT'S ALL!"</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>April 22, 1915</i>)</p>


<p>The night of April twenty-second was probably the
most momentous time of the six days and nights of
fighting. Then the Germans concentrated on the Yser
Canal, over which there was but one bridge, a murderous
barrage fire which would have effectively hindered
the bringing up of reinforcements or guns, even
had we had any in reserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>During the early stages of the battle, the enemy had
succeeded to a considerable degree in turning the
Canadian left wing. There was a large open gap at
this point, where the French Colonial troops had stood
until the gas came over. Toward this sector the
Germans rushed rank after rank of infantry, backed
by guns and heavy artillery. To the far distant left
were our British comrades. They were completely
blocked by the German advance. They were like rats
in a trap and could not move.</p>

<p>At the start of the battle, the Canadian lines ran
from the village of Langemarck over to St. Julien, a
distance of approximately three to four miles. From
St. Julien to the sector where the Imperial British
had joined the Turcos was a distance of probably two
miles.</p>

<p>These two miles had to be covered, and covered
quickly. We had to save the British extreme right
wing, and we had to close the gap. There was no question
about it. It was our job. On the night of April
the twenty-second we commenced to put this into effect.
We were still holding our original position with
the handful of men who were in reserves, all of whom
had been included in the original grand total of twelve
thousand. We had to spread out across the gap of
two miles and link up the British right wing. Doing
this was no easy task. Our company was out first
and we were told to get into field-skirmishing order.
We lined up in the pitchy darkness at five paces apart,
but no sooner had we reached this than a whispered
order passed from man to man: "Another pace, lads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
just another pace". This order came again and yet
again. Before we were through and ready for the
command to advance, we were at least twice five paces
each man from his nearest comrade.</p>

<p>Then it was that our Captain told us bluntly that
we were obviously outnumbered by the Germans, ten
to one. Then he told us that, practically speaking,
we had scarcely the ghost of a chance, but that a bluff
might succeed. He told us to "swing the lead over
them". This we did by yelling, hooting, shouting,
clamouring, until it seemed, and the enemy believed,
that we were ten to their one.</p>

<p>The ruse succeeded. At daybreak, when we rested,
we found that we had driven the enemy back almost
to his original position. All night long we had been
fighting with our backs to our comrades who were in
the front trenches. The enemy had got behind us and
we had had to face about in what served for trenches.
By dawn we had him back again in his original position,
and we were facing in the old direction. By
dawn we had almost, though not quite, forced a junction
with the British right.</p>

<p>The night of April the twenty-second is one that I
can never forget. It was frightful, yes. Yet there
was a grandeur in the appalling intensity of living,
in the appalling intensity of death as it surrounded us.</p>

<p>The German shells rose and burst behind us. They
made the Yser Canal a stream of molten glory. Shells
fell in the city, and split the darkness of the heavens
in the early night hours. Later, the moon rose in the
splendour of springtime. Straight behind the tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the great cathedral it rose and shone down on a
bloody earth.</p>

<p>Suddenly the grand old Cloth Hall burst into flames.
The spikes of fire rose and fell and rose again.
Showers of sparks went upward. A pall of smoke
would form and cloud the moon, waver, break, and
pass. There was the mutter and rumble and roar of
great guns.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It was glorious. It was terrible. It was inspiring.
Through an inferno of destruction and death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
we lived because we must.</p>

<p>Perhaps our greatest reward came when on April
twenty-sixth the English troops reached us. We had
been completely cut off by the enemy barrage from all
communication with other sectors of the line. Still,
through the wounded gone back, word of our stand
had drifted out. The English boys fought and force-marched
and fought again their terrible way through
the barrage to our aid, and when they arrived, weary
and worn and torn, cutting their bloody way to us,
they cheered themselves hoarse; cheered as they
marched along, cheered and gripped our hands as they
got within touch of us. Yell after yell went upward,
and stirring words woke the echoes. The boys of the
Old Country paid their greatest tribute to us of the
New as they cried:</p>

<p>"Canadians&mdash;Canadians&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM "THE WAR AND THE SOUL"</h2>


<p>I do not for one moment believe that the world is
less Christian than it was before the war, or less
intent on spiritual things. The exact contrary is the
case as far as my experience goes. I have more than
once stated that, if any man wants to be cured of
religious pessimism, or any other kind of pessimism,
he had better go to the front. If I had been an unbeliever
before I went there, I should speedily have
been cured. There one sees things every day, almost
every hour, to make one marvel at the greatness of
the human soul. You will see hell wide open, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
true, but you will see heaven likewise. Such heroism,
patience, self-devotion, cheerfulness under affliction,
readiness to fling life away to save a comrade or a
position&mdash;surely these mean more, and are worth more,
than the immediate object of their exercise.</p>

<p class='center'><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span></p>

<p>As humanity has been constituted up to the present,
war has been the means, more than any other agency,
of bringing out on the grand scale that truth of sacrifice
without which flesh can never be made to serve
the ends of spirit, and the kingdom of the soul be won.
This could be realized without war if only the race
as a whole could be lifted to the requisite level. It
often has been realized without war in individual
cases, but never for long on the wider basis of the
communal life.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>What men are learning on the battle-fields of Europe
of the glory of sacrifice and its mystical potencies
is drawing them back to God by way of the cross of
Christ; our vulgar, blatant, worldly, commercial,
pleasure-loving age is seeing meanings in that cross
it never saw before, and getting rid of many delusions
in the process. We are being saved as by fire. Let us
recover the simplicities of life, and we recover faith.
We are re-learning the old, old lesson that man cannot
live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of God. We are realizing almost
with the surprise of a new discovery, that not what we
have but what we are, is the secret of blessedness or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
wretchedness, that there is nothing to mourn over but
the evil in our own hearts, and that death, however
sad and dreadful in its accompaniments, is but the
prelude to vaster ventures of the soul and unimaginable
joys. Nothing can be killed that is worthy to be
kept alive or essential to our highest well-being here
or hereafter.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM LECTURE<br />"HOW WE STAND NOW"</h2>


<p>For my own part I am more proud of Great Britain
than ever in my life before, and that largely because,
in spite of this froth or scum that sometimes floats
on the surface, she is fundamentally true to her great
traditions, and treads steadily underfoot those elements
which, if they had control, would depose us
from being a nation of "white men", of rulers, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gentlemen, and bring us to the level of the enemy
whom we denounce, or of the "lesser breeds without
the law".</p>

<p>Probably many of us have learned only through this
war how much we loved our country. That love
depends, of course, not mainly on pride, but on old
habit and familiarity, on neighbourliness, and memories
of childhood. Yet, mingling with that love for
our old country, I do feel a profound pride. I am
proud of the response to the Empire's call&mdash;a response
absolutely unexampled in history, five million men and
more gathering from the ends of the earth; subjects
of the British Empire coming to offer life and limb
for the Empire, not because they were subjects, but
because they were free and willing to come. I am
proud of our soldiers and our sailors, our invincible
sailors!</p>

<p>I am proud of our men in the workshop and the
factory; proud of our men, and almost more proud
of our women&mdash;working one and all, day after day,
with constant overtime, and practically no holidays,
for the most part demanding no trade safeguards, and
insisting on no conditions, but giving freely to the
common cause all that they have to give.</p>

<p>I am proud of our political leaders and civil administrators,
proud of their resource, their devotion, their
unshaken coolness, their magnanimity in the face of
intrigue and detraction, their magnificent interpretation
of the nation's will.</p>

<p>A few days ago I was in France in the fire-zone. I
had been at a field dressing-station, which had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
evacuated its wounded and dead, and was expecting
more; and, as evening was falling, full of the uncanny
strain of the whole place and slightly deafened with
the shells, I saw a body of men in full kit plodding
their way up the communication trenches to take their
place in the firing trench. I was just going back
myself, well out of the range of the guns, to a comfortable
tea and a peaceful evening; and there, in
trench after trench, along all the hundred miles of
our front, day after day, night after night, were men
moving heavily up to the firing-line, to pay their
regular toll of so many killed and so many wounded,
while the war drags on its weary length. I suddenly
wondered in my heart whether we or our cause or our
country is worth that sacrifice; and, with my mind
full of its awfulness, I answered clearly, Yes. Because,
while I am proud of all the things I have mentioned
about Great Britain, I am most proud of the clean
hands with which we came into this contest; proud
of the Cause for which with clear vision we unsheathed
our sword, and which we mean to maintain unshaken
to the bitter or the triumphant end.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM SPEECH AT THE GUILDHALL,<br />
LONDON, ENGLAND</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>July 29, 1915</i>)</p>


<p>In the Dominions beyond the seas the same ideals
have led inevitably to the establishment of self-governing
institutions. That principle, which in the eyes
of the short-sighted seemed destined to drive the far-flung
nations of our empire asunder, has but united
them by ties stronger than could be dreamed of under
any system of autocratic government. Australia,
New Zealand, South Africa, Canada&mdash;all these great
free nations possessing full rights of self-government,
enjoying parliamentary institutions, living by the voice
of the people&mdash;why have they joined in this conflict,
and why are their citizens from the remotest corners
of the earth fighting under a common banner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
making common cause with the men of these islands
in the greatest war the world has ever known? And
why are the descendants in Canada of those who fought
under Wolfe, and of those who fought under Montcalm,
when contending for the northern half of the American
continent, why are they now standing together in the
empire's battle line? To speak of later events, why
do we find beyond the Channel, in France or in Belgium,
the grandson of a Durham and the grandson of
a Papineau standing side by side in this struggle?
When the historian of the future comes to analyse
the events of this war, he will realize that some great
overmastering impulse contributed mainly to this wonderful
result. One such impulse is to be found in the
love of liberty, the ideals of democracy, and the spirit
of unity founded thereon, which make the whole empire
one in aim and purpose. But there was also the
intense conviction that this war was forced upon our
empire; for in honour we could not stand aside and
see trampled in the dust a weak and unoffending
people whose independence and liberties we had guaranteed.
Beyond and above all this we realized the
supreme truth that the issue forced upon us by this
conflict transcends even the destinies of our own
empire and involves the future of civilization and of
the world.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM "THE MEANING OF WAR"</h2>

<p>The moral energy of nations, as of individuals, is
only sustained by an ideal higher than themselves, and
stronger than themselves, to which they cling firmly
when they feel their courage waver. Where is the
ideal of the Germany of to-day? The time when her
philosophers proclaimed the inviolability of right, the
eminent dignity of the person, the duty of mutual
respect among nations, is no more. Germany, militarized
by Prussia, has cast aside those noble ideas, ideas
she received for the most part from the France of the
eighteenth century and of the Revolution. She has
made for herself a new soul, or rather she has meekly
accepted the soul Bismarck has given her. To him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
has been attributed the famous maxim "Might is
Right". But in truth Bismarck never pronounced it,
for he had well guarded himself against a distinction
of right from might. Right was simply in his view
what is willed by the strongest, what is consigned by
the conqueror in the law he imposes on the conquered.
In that is summed up his whole morality. Germany
to-day knows no other. She, too, worships brute force.
And because she believes herself the strongest, she is
altogether absorbed in self-adoration. Her energy
comes from her pride. Her moral force is only the
confidence which her material force inspires in her.
And this means that in this respect she is living
on reserves without means of replenishment. Even
before England had commenced to blockade her coasts,
she had blockaded herself morally, in isolating herself
from every ideal capable of giving her new life.</p>

<p>So she will see her forces waste and her courage at
the same time. But the energy of our soldiers is
drawn from something which does not waste, from an
ideal of justice and freedom. Time has no hold on
us. To the force which feeds only on its own brutality
we are opposing that which seeks outside and above
itself a principle of life and renovation. Whilst the
one is gradually spending itself, the other is continually
re-making itself. The one is already wavering,
the other abides unshaken. Have no fear, our force
will slay theirs.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM "FEAR GOD AND TAKE YOUR<br />
OWN PART"</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>February, 1916</i>)</p>


<p>The English navy was mobilized with a rapidity
and efficiency as great as that of the German army.
It has driven every warship except an occasional submarine,
and every merchant ship of Germany off the
seas, and has kept the ocean as a highway of life not
only for England, but for France, and largely also for
Russia. In all history there has been no such gigantic
and successful naval feat accomplished as that which
the seamen and shipwrights of England have to their
credit during the last eighteen months. It was not
originally expected that England would have much
to do on the continent; and although her wisest sons
emphatically desired that she should be ready to do
more, yet this desire represented only a recognition of
the duty owed by England to herself. To her Allies
she has more than kept the promise she has made.
She has given Russia the financial assistance that none
but she could give; her money effort has been unparalleled
in all previous history. Eighteen months ago
no Frenchman would have expected that in the event
of war England would do more than put a couple of
hundred thousand men in France. She has already
put in a million, and is training and arming more
than double that number. Her soldiers have done
their duty fearlessly and well; they have won high
honour on the fields of horror and glory; they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
shown the same gallantry and stubborn valour that
have been so evident in the armies of France and
Russia. Her women are working with all the steadfast
courage and self-sacrifice that the women of
France have shown. Her men from every class have
thronged into the army. Her fisher folk, and her seafarers
generally, have come forward in such numbers
that her fleet is nearly double as strong as it was at
the outset of the war. Her mines and war factories
have steadily enlarged their output, and it is now
enormous, although many of the factories had literally
to build from the ground up, and the very plant itself
had to be created.</p>

<p>Coal, food, guns, munitions, are being supplied with
sustained energy. From across the sea the free Commonwealths
of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and
South Africa, and the Indian Empire, have responded
with splendid loyalty, and have sent their sons from
the ends of the earth to do battle for liberty and civilization.
Of Canada I can speak from personal knowledge.
Canada has faced the time that tries men's
souls, and with gallant heroism she has risen level to
the time's need. Mighty days have come to her, and
she has been equal to the mighty days. Greatness
comes only through labour and courage, through the
iron willingness to face sorrow and death, the tears of
women and the blood of men, if only thereby it is
possible to serve a lofty ideal. Canada has won that
honourable place among the nations of the past and
the present which can only come to the people whose
sons are willing and able to dare and do and die at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
need. The spirit shown by her sister-commonwealths
is the same. High of heart and undaunted of soul the
men and women of the British Islands and of the
whole British Empire now front the crisis that is upon
them.</p>

<h2>VERDUN</h2>

<p>(<i>Spoken in the vault of the citadel of Verdun, September, 1916</i>)</p>


<p>I wish to tell you how glad I am that you asked me
to sit at table with your officers in the heart of
Verdun's citadel. I am glad to see around me those
who have come back from battle, those who will be
fighting to-morrow, and those who, with you, General,
are sentries on these impregnable walls. The name of
Verdun alone will be enough to rouse imperishable
memories throughout the centuries to come. There is
not one of the great feats of arms which make the
history of France which better shows the high qualities
of the Army and the people of France; and that
bravery and devotion to country, to which the world
has ever paid homage, have been strengthened by a
sang-froid and tenacity which yield nothing to British
phlegm.</p>

<p>The memory of the victorious resistance of Verdun
will be immortal because Verdun saved not only
France, but the whole of the great cause which is
common to ourselves and humanity. The evil-working
force of the enemy has broken itself against the heights
around this old citadel as an angry sea breaks upon a
granite rock. These heights have conquered the storm
which threatened the world.</p>

<p>I am deeply moved when I tread this sacred soil,
and I do not speak for myself alone. I bring you a
tribute of the admiration of my country, of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Empire which I represent here. They bow with me
before your sacrifice and before your glory. Once
again, for the defence of the great causes with which
its very future is bound up, mankind turns to France.

<p>I should like to say one word about the lesson of
the fighting on the western front&mdash;not about the military
strategy, but about the significance of the whole
of that great struggle, one of the greatest struggles
ever waged in the history of the world. It is full of
encouragement and of hope. Just look at it! An
absolutely new Army! The old had done its duty and
spent itself in the achievement of that great task.
This is a new Army. But a year ago it was ore in the
earth of Britain, yea, and of Ireland. It became iron.
It has passed through a fiery furnace, and the enemy
knows that it is now fine steel. An absolutely new
Army, new men, new officers taken from schools, from
colleges, from counting-houses, never trained to war,
never thought of war, many of them perhaps never
handled a weapon of war, generals never given the
opportunity of handling great masses of men. Some
of us had seen the manœuvres. A division which is
now set to attack a small village is more than our
generals ever had the opportunity of handling before
the war. Compared with the great manœuvres on the
Continent, they were toy manœuvres. And yet this
new Army, new men, new officers, generals new to this
kind of work, they have faced the greatest army in the
world, the greatest army the world has ever seen, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
best equipped and the best trained, and they have
beaten them, beaten them, beaten them! Battle after
battle, day after day, week after week! From the
strongest entrenchments ever devised by human skill
they have driven them out by valour, by valour which
is incredible when you read the story of it.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM PRESIDENT WILSON'S<br />
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>April 2, 1917</i>)</p>


<p>We are now about to accept the gage of battle
with this natural foe to liberty, and shall, if necessary,
spend the whole force of the nation to check and
nullify its pretensions and powers. We are glad, now
that we see the facts with no veil of false pretence
about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the
world and for the liberation of its peoples, the German
people included; for the rights of nations great and
small, and the privilege of men everywhere to choose
their way of life and of obedience. The world must
be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be
planted upon the trusted foundations of political
liberty.</p>

<p>We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no
conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for
ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices
we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions
of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied
when those have been made as secure as the faith and
freedom of the nation can make them.</p>

<p>Just because we fight without rancour and without
selfish objects, seeking nothing for ourselves but what
we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall,
I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents
without passion and ourselves observe with proud
punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
profess to be fighting for.... We enter this war
only where we are clearly forced into it because there
are no other means of defending our rights.</p>

<p>It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves
as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness
because we act without animus, not in enmity toward
a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage
upon them, but only in armed opposition
to an irresponsible Government which has thrown
aside all considerations of humanity and of right and
is running amuck.... There are, it may be, many
months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us.</p>

<p>It is a fearful thing to lead this great, peaceful
people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous
of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the
balance. But right is more precious than peace, and
we shall fight for the things which we have always
carried nearest to our hearts&mdash;for democracy, for the
right of those who submit to authority to have a voice
in their own governments, for the rights and liberties
of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by
such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and
safety to all nations and make the world itself at last
free.</p>

<p>To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our
fortunes, everything that we are and everything that
we have, with the pride of those who know that the
day has come when America is privileged to spend
her blood and her might for the principles that gave
her birth and happiness and the peace which she has
treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF<br />
RT. HON. A. J. BALFOUR IN TORONTO</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>May, 1917</i>)</p>


<p>I come into Canada to a great free country, composed
not only of friends, but of countrymen. We
think the same thoughts, we live in the same civilization,
we belong to the same Empire, and if anything
could have cemented more closely the bonds of Empire,
if anything could have made us feel that we were
indeed of one flesh and one blood, with one common
history behind us, if anything could have cemented
these feelings, it is the consciousness that now for two
years and a half we have been engaged in this great
struggle, in which, I thank God, all North America
is now at one. We have been engaged in this great
struggle through these two years and a half, fighting
together, when necessary making all our sacrifices in
common, working together toward a common and victorious
end, which I doubt not will crown our efforts.</p>

<p>May I, as a countryman of yours, though not a
citizen of Toronto, may I say how profoundly the whole
Empire feels the magnitude of the effort you have made,
and how we value it for itself and for an example to
all posterity, an evidence to the whole world of what
the British Empire really means, not only for the whole
of that civilized body of nations of which we form no
inconsiderable part.</p>

<p>These are proud thoughts; they will some day be
proud memories. We are associated together in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
struggle never equalled yet in the history of the world,
and I rejoice to think that in that struggle on which
posterity will look back as the greatest effort made
for freedom and civilization, the British Empire in
every one of its constituent parts, and surely not least
in this great Dominion, in this proud Province, and in
this city not least, has shown what the unity of the
Empire really means, and how vain were the anticipations
of those who thought that we were constituted
but a fair-weather Empire, to be dissolved into thin
atoms at the first storm that should burst upon it.</p>

<p>We have, on the contrary, shown that the more
storms beat on the fabric of our Empire the more
firmly it held together, and were so far from shaking
it in any single part. Events that have recently
occurred, that are occurring, and that will occur in
the future, will join every part of it together for ever in
memories which will remain with us, the actors in this
great drama, until we die, and which we shall be able
to hand to our children and our grandchildren as long
as civilization exists.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM SPEECH OF<br />
MONSIEUR VIVIANI IN OTTAWA</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>May 12, 1917</i>)</p>


<p>It must not be forgotten that in the month of
February, 1915, at Ypres, in the north of France, near
the Belgian frontier, in a country devastated by floods,
after the terrific assault of the German soldiers by
means of asphyxiating gases&mdash;Germany, the country
that has caused science to swerve from its true ends,
and, instead of pouring its benefits upon mankind, has
visited humanity with manifold evils and crimes&mdash;that
same Germany had to meet your Canadian soldiers.
On that terrific day, your sons, rising in their might,
saved the situation.</p>

<p>And throughout many battles, throughout numerous
and recent victories, the soldiers of Canada stood
up heroically against the foe. Even at this moment,
we have before our eyes your boys, so alert, so athletic,
so brave, the first to storm, victoriously carrying their
flag to those heights of Vimy which were reputed to be
impregnable.</p>

<p>Hail to all these soldiers; let us bow our heads
reverently before those who fight, those who suffer,
and those who have laid down their lives for their
country. They had a clear perception of what their
action meant; when they left this country they were
well aware that it was not only Great Britain that
they were called upon to defend, that it was not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
France that they were going to protect against the
attacks of invaders:&mdash;their clear vision upturned
toward Heaven, detected the higher object; they were
well aware that it was the sacred cause of humanity,
of democracy, and of justice, that they were
defending.</p>

<p>I thank you, with all my heart, for the warmth of

me will be heard in France. I know the services rendered

RT. HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>(<i>Delivered at Queen's Hall on the Third Anniversary of the
Declaration of War, August 4, 1917</i>)</p></blockquote>


<p>While the Army is fighting so valiantly, let the
nation behind it be patient, be strong, and, above all,
united. The strain is great on nations and on individuals,
and when men get over-strained tempers get
ragged, and small grievances are exaggerated, and
small misunderstandings and mistakes swell into
mountains. Long wars, like long voyages and long
journeys, are very trying to the temper, and wise men
keep watch on it and make allowances for it. There
are some who are more concerned about ending the
war than about winning it; and plans which lead to
victory, if they prolong the conflict, have their disapproval,
and the people who are responsible for such
plans have their condemnation. Let us keep our eye
steadily on the winning of the war. May I say let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
keep both eyes? Some have a cast in their eye, and
while one eye is fixed truly on victory, the other is
wandering around to other issues or staring stonily at
some pet or partisan project of their own. Beware
of becoming cross-eyed! Keep both eyes on victory.
Look neither to the right nor to the left. That is the
way we shall win. If any one promotes national distrust
or disunion at this hour, he is helping the enemy
and hurting his native land. And it makes no difference
whether he is for or against the war. As a
matter of fact, the hurt is deeper if he is for the war,
because whatever the pure pacifist says is discounted,
and, as far as the war is concerned, discredited.</p>

<p>Let there be one thought in every head. If you
sow distrust, discontent, disunion in the nation we
shall reap defeat. If, on the other hand, we sow the
seeds of patience, confidence, and unity, we shall
garner in victory and its fruits. The last ridges of a
climb are always the most trying to the nerves and to
the heart, but the real test of great endurance and
courage is the last few hundreds or scores of feet in
a climb upwards. The climber who turns back when
he is almost there never becomes a great mountaineer,
and the nation that turns back and falters before it
reaches its purpose never becomes a great people. You
have all had experience in climbing, no doubt&mdash;perhaps
in Wales. Any mountaineer can start; any
sort of mountaineer can go part of the way; and very
often the poorer the mountaineer, the greater is his
ardour when he does start; but fatigue and danger
wear out all but the stoutest hearts, and even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
most stout-hearted sometimes fail when they come to
the last slippery precipice. But if they do turn back
and afterwards look up and see how near they had got
to the top, how they curse the faint-heartedness which
bade them give up when they were so near the goal!</p>

<h2>ORDER TO THE CANADIAN ARMY CORPS</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>March 27, 1918</i>)</p>


<p>Looking back with pride on the unbroken record
of your glorious achievements, asking you to realize
that to-day the fate of the British Empire hangs in the
balance, I place my trust in the Canadian Corps, knowing
that where Canadians are engaged, there can be
no giving way. Under the orders of your devoted
officers in the coming battle, you will advance, or fall
where you stand, facing the enemy.</p>

<p>To those who fall, I say: "You will not die, but step
into immortality. Your mothers will not lament your
fate, but will be proud to have borne such sons. Your
names will be revered for ever by your grateful country,
and God will take you unto Himself."</p>

<p>Canadians, in this fateful hour, I command you
and I trust you to fight as you have ever fought, with
all your strength, with all your determination, with
all your tranquil courage. On many a hard-fought
field of battle you have overcome this enemy, and with
God's help you shall achieve victory once more.</p>

<h2>AN HISTORIC ORDER</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, April 12, 1918</i>)</p>


<p>Three weeks ago to-day the enemy began his terrific
attacks against us on a fifty-mile front. His objects
were to separate us from the French, to take the
Channel Ports, and to destroy the British Army.</p>

<p>In spite of throwing already one hundred and six
divisions into the battle, and enduring the most reckless
sacrifice of human life, he has yet made little
progress toward his goals.</p>

<p>We owe this to the determined fighting and self-sacrifice
of our troops. Words fail me to express the
admiration which I feel for the splendid resistance
offered by all ranks of our army under the most trying
circumstances.</p>

<p>Many among us now are tired. To those I would
say that victory will belong to the side which holds
out the longest. The French Army is moving rapidly
and in great force to our support. There is no other
course open to us but to fight it out.</p>

<p>Every position must be held to the last man. There
must be no retirement. With our backs to the wall,
and believing in the justice of our cause, each one of
us must fight to the end. The safety of our homes and
the freedom of mankind depend alike upon the conduct
of each one of us at this critical moment.</p>

<h2>SPEECH DELIVERED BY LIEUT.-GEN. SIR A. W.<br />
CURRIE IN LONDON BEFORE AUGUST<br />
OFFENSIVE, 1918</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Just before the Canadian entrance into the great offensive of
August, 1918, General Sir Arthur W. Currie, during a short visit
to London, delivered the following message from the Canadian
Army Corps under his command:</p></blockquote>


<p>The situation is a serious one, and it is better for
all peoples to know the fact. Germany has struck
four mighty blows with success on each occasion, and
it is just a question of how many of these blows we
can stand. Personally, I think that the factor that
can be turned in our favour is this: If we stop and
fight the Boche, we will kill a sufficient number to
make him silly, while America develops enough
strength to turn the man power in our favour. The
British soldier realizes that he is a better man than
the Boche, and he believes that the German army can
be beaten. Our men do not regard the Boche as a
superman; and, remembering the crimes they have
committed, we shall never take such delight in killing
them as when we next meet them. Germany is simply
a mad dog that must be killed, a cancerous growth
that must be removed.</p>

<p>I suppose that I am the proudest man in the
British Isles to-night, but I am not the happiest. I
am the proudest man because I command the finest
fighting force in all the Allied armies. An officer of
Canadian birth, who has spent the whole of his military
career with the British Army, and married an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
English wife, told me the other day that he was proud
to be a Canadian, for everywhere he went men spoke
of the deeds of the Canadian Army Corps. When the
women with their children and the old men were fleeing
before enemy forces on the Western Front on a
not very distant occasion, and learned that the troops
meeting them were Canadians, they turned round and
went back home. On another occasion, when visiting
a British Headquarters, I saw a Brigadier sitting by
the roadside, tired, and dirty, and wan. He called
out, "Who's that coming along?" When the reply
was, "General Currie", he said, "Are the Canadians
coming down here?" Told that they were, he threw
his hat in the air and declared, "Then we are all right
now".</p>

<p>When we came to England first, we were not
regarded as the finest fighting soldiers. We had many
things said about us unjustly; and suggestions were
put about that it was improbable we should ever
become good soldiers. Everywhere to-day, at General
Headquarters and all other places, it is recognized
that Canadian soldiers are fit to take their place beside
the veteran soldiers of the British Army, with whom
we are proud to serve.</p>

<p>I know that it has been said that Canadians and
other Overseas troops are placed in the hottest parts
of the war area. The greatest fighting of the war
has been this year, and we have not taken any particular
part in it. The Boche has not attacked the
Canadian Front. He knows that he has never yet met
the troops from Canada without suffering severely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
The turn of the Canadian Corps must come. The
temper of the Canadian soldier is that there is no
position he is asked to take that he will not take; and
I know that the Boche will not take any part of our
line, except over the dead bodies of your Canadian
fellow-citizens. That is why I am not the happiest
man in the British Isles to-night. The Canadian Corps
is going to die. It is simply a question of who can
stand killing the longer.</p>

<p>I have never seen the Corps in finer fighting fettle
than it is to-day. The Canadians are now more efficient
than ever; and we could not be in that position
unless we were backed up by General Sir Richard
Turner and his staff in England. There is a feeling
of co-operation now that never existed before; and
the better the liaison we have between France, England,
and Canada, the better it is for the fighting
forces.</p>

<p>And so we stand in a great cause, on the eve of
great events. We have to preserve the British Empire.
It would be a terrible calamity if anything should
happen that would make the peoples of the British
Empire hesitate at such a juncture. The British
Empire must be saved.</p>

<h2>EXTRACTS FROM SPEECH</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>September, 1918</i>)</p>


<p>Canada's war record is made, though not completed.
Nothing she can do in the future will detract
from her great past in this world struggle. She has
shown herself a true daughter of Great Britain. She
has spared neither sons nor treasure to help her Alma
Mater to save the world.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the Right Hon. Sir Eric Geddes, G.B.E., K.C.B., M.P., First Lord of the Admiralty</span></div>

<p>Now that the last and most formidable of our
enemies has acknowledged the triumph of the Allied
arms on behalf of right and justice, I wish to express
my praise and thankfulness to the officers, men, and
women of the Royal Navy and Marines, with their
comrades of the Fleet auxiliaries and mercantile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
marine, who for more than four years have kept open
the sea, protected our shores, and given us safety.</p>

<p>Ever since that fateful Fourth of August, 1914, I
have remained steadfast in my confidence that, whether
fortune frowned or smiled, the Royal Navy would once
more prove the sure shield of the British Empire in
the hour of trial.</p>

<p>Never in its history has the Royal Navy, with God's
help, done greater things for us, nor better sustained
its old glories and the chivalry of the seas.</p>

<p>With full and grateful hearts the peoples of the
British Empire salute the White, the Red, and the
Blue Ensigns, and those who have given their lives for
the Flag.</p>

<p>I am proud to have served in the Navy. I am
prouder still to be its head on this memorable day.</p>

<h2>ORDER TO THE CANADIANS<br />
AFTER THE CAPTURE OF MONS</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>November, 1918</i>)</p>


<p>Some of you have already commenced, while others
are about to march on the Rhine, liberating Belgium
in your advance. In a few days you will enter Germany
and hold certain parts, in order to secure the
fulfilment of the terms of the armistice preliminary
to the peace treaty. The rulers of Germany, humiliated
and demoralized, have fled. That unscrupulous
nation, who in 1914 set at naught every treaty and
violated every moral obligation, who has since perpetrated
the most ferocious atrocities on land as well as
on sea, is beaten, famished, and at our mercy. Justice
has come. Retribution commences. During four long
years, conscious of the righteousness of your cause,
you have fought many battles and endured cruel hardships,
and now your mighty efforts are rewarded.
Your fallen comrades are avenged. You have demonstrated
on the battle-field your superior courage and
unfaltering energy. By the will of God you have won,
won, won, marching triumphantly through Belgium.
You will be received everywhere as liberators, but the
kindness and generosity of the population must not
cause any relaxation of your discipline or alertness.
Your task is not yet completed, and you must remain
what you are&mdash;a close-knitted army in grim, deadly
earnest. German agents scattered throughout the
country must not be able to report to their German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
masters any weakness or evidence of disintegration
of your fighting power. It is essential that on the
march and at the halt discipline must be of the highest
standard. Every possible protection should be taken
at all times to guard against hostile acts by organized
bodies, and to lessen the possibilities, always present,
of isolated murders or desperate guerilla acts by factions
of the enemy. Above all, it is of capital importance
to establish in Germany the sense of your overwhelming
moral and physical standing, so as to complete
by the presence of your potential strength the
victories you have won on the battle-field. All external
signs of discipline must be insisted upon, and the
example in this, as in all instances, must come from
the leaders.</p>

<p>Clothing and equipment must be, if possible, spotless,
well kept, and well put on. Badges and distinguishing
marks must be complete, while the transport
should be as clean as the circumstances will allow.
In short, you must continue to be, and appear to be,
that powerful-hitting force which has won the fear
and respect of your foes and the admiration of the
world.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to say that the population and
private property will be respected. You will always
remember that you fought for justice, right, and
decency, and that you cannot afford to fall short of
these essentials, even in the country against which you
have every right to feel bitter.</p>

<p>Rest assured that the crimes of Germany will
receive adequate punishment. Attempts will be made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
by insidious propaganda, to undermine the source of
your strength; but you, the soldier citizens of the
finest and most advanced democracy in the world, will
treat such attempts with the contempt they deserve.
You know that self-imposed, stern discipline has made
you the hardest, most successful, and cleanest fighters
of this war. Beginning by the immortal stand at the
second battle of Ypres, you befittingly closed by the
capture of Mons your fighting record, in which every
battle you fought is a resplendent page of glory. I
trust you, and the people at home trust you, while the
memory of your dead comrades demands of you to
bring back that glorious record, pure and unsullied,
to Canada.</p>

<h2>ON THE NAVY</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>December, 1918</i>)</p>


<p>Our safety from invasion, our daily bread, every
means whereby we maintain our existence as an independent
people, our unity as an Empire, or federation
of commonwealths and dependencies&mdash;all these float
from hour to hour upon our naval defence.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>If that defence is neglected, weakened, or fettered,
we should be in continual danger of subjugation or
starvation. We should be forced to live in continued
anxiety. If that naval defence were overthrown or
outmatched by any other Navy or probably by a combination
of navies, we should hold, not merely our
possessions, but our lives and liberties only on
sufferance.</p>

<p>Where else in the whole world can such conditions
be paralleled? We have the right to demand from
all other nations, friends and foes alike, full recognition
of these facts. We are also entitled to point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
out that this naval strength that we require, and which
we are determined to preserve, has never been used in
modern history in a selfish and aggressive manner,
and that it has, on four separate occasions, in four
separate centuries&mdash;against Philip the Second of
Spain, Louis the Fourteenth, Napoleon, and the Kaiser&mdash;successfully
defended civilization from military
tyranny, and particularly, preserved the independence
of the Low Countries.</p>

<p>In this greatest of all wars, the British Navy
shielded mighty America from all menace of serious
danger; and, when she resolved to act, it was the
British Navy that transported and escorted the greater
proportion of her armies to the rescue and deliverance
of France.</p>

<p>Our record in a hundred years of unquestioned
naval sway since Trafalgar, proves the sobriety of our
policy and the righteousness of our intentions. Almost
the only ports in the world open freely to the commerce
of all nations were those of our Island. Its
possessions and our coaling-stations were used freely
and fully by ships of all nations. We suppressed the
slave trade. We put down piracy. We put it down
again the other day. Even our coastwise traffic, so
jealously guarded by every Power in the world, was
thrown open to all comers on even terms, by that
ancient people in whose keeping the world has been
wisely ready to intrust the freedom of the seas.</p>

<h2>KING GEORGE IN PARIS</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>November 28, 1918</i>)</p>


<p><small>In proposing the health of President Poincaré, the King
said:</small></p>

<p>It is difficult for me adequately to express the
great pleasure that I feel in being your guest here
to-night in this fair city of Paris, and in the midst
of the great nation with which during past years I and
my people have mingled our sorrows and our joys, and
are now triumphantly crowned by overwhelming victory
over the common enemy.</p>

<p>We can all remember the repeated and desperate
efforts made by the German armies to reach and capture
this great capital; but, thanks to the bravery of
the splendid French Army and the loyal co-operation
of the Allies, the aims of the enemy have been defeated;
and by the skilful direction and the strategy of the
distinguished Marshal Foch, the troops of the invader
have been hurled across the frontier and compelled to
sue for peace.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I congratulate you and the noble
French nation upon the great victory that has been
achieved, in which my generals and armies are proud
to have taken part. In the life and death conflict in
which our nations have been together engaged for
civilization and for right against the methods of barbarism
and the forces of destruction, the French and
British peoples have learned in unity of purpose to
appreciate each other and their respective ideals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>They have created a union of hearts and an identity
of interests that, I trust, will ever grow closer,
and contribute materially to the consolidation of peace
and the advancement of civilization.</p>

<p>Lastly, let me add one word of sympathy for those
heroic Frenchmen and French women who have suffered
at the hands of the invader such as few have
suffered, except in Belgium. And let us not forget the
immortal dead, whose names will ever be enshrined in
one of the most glorious pages of the history of the
world.</p>

<p>My soldiers have fought during all these years of
relentless war side by side with the soldiers of France,
whose valiant deeds have added fresh lustre to their
immortal traditions. The sailors of our two navies
have, together, kept these as in a comradeship and
mutual trust which the length of the war itself has
only served more and more to foster and strengthen.</p>

<p>With all my heart I thank you for your friendly
feelings and the terms in which you have proposed
my health. Accept also my cordial thanks for your
generous hospitality and for the opportunity which
you have afforded me in these ever memorable days of
victory to pay my respectful homage to the French
nation.</p>

<h2>BRITAIN'S DAY</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>December 7, 1918</i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(This message was cabled to the United States on the day
set apart for publicly acknowledging the achievements of the
British Empire in the Great War.)</p></blockquote>


<p>The achievements of the British Empire for
humanity are too manifold to enumerate in a short
message. Entering the war to defend the rights of
nations, she has unhesitatingly given her sons and her
wealth. Gathered from her loyal dominions, the men
of the British Empire have carried their victorious
eagles over many a bloody field. Steadfast in adversity,
wounded with a thousand wounds, Britain's
hammer blows have never weakened or faltered. But
for the tenacity of her people the war would have been
lost.</p>

<p>To those of us who have been associated with them
and who have fought beside their gallant troops, words
of praise seem inadequate to express our admiration.
These things our kinsmen have done, and these things
have brought an inseparable union between them and
ourselves. To the British people, we extend our
thanks for the powerful aid her navy has given, and
offer our great respect for the resolute Anglo-Saxon
determination with which she has held on, and we
offer our right hand of friendship that our two nations
may be more firmly linked together to insure the
future peace of the world.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM<br />
FIELD-MARSHAL SIR DOUGLAS HAIG'S<br />
OFFICIAL REPORT</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>January, 1919</i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(Too great an emphasis cannot be placed on the following paragraph
from Sir Douglas Haig's official report of January, 1919,
on the operations along the British front during the last days
of the Great War. That the German army was thoroughly
beaten when the armistice was declared, is here put beyond
doubt by this laconic summary of the military situation, when
the order to cease firing was proclaimed.)</p></blockquote>


<p>The military situation on the British front on the
morning of the 11th November can be stated very
shortly. In the fighting since November 1st, our
troops had broken the enemy's resistance beyond possibility
of recovery, and had forced on him a disorderly
retreat along the whole front of the British armies.
Thereafter, the enemy was capable neither of accepting
nor refusing battle. The utter confusion of his troops,
the state of his railways, congested with abandoned
trains, the capture of huge quantities of rolling stock
and material, all showed that our attack had been
decisive.</p>

<h2>PRESIDENT POINCARÉ AT THE OPENING OF<br />
THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>January 18, 1919</i>)</p>


<p>Gentlemen: France greets and thanks you for
having chosen as the seat of your labours the city
which for more than four years the enemy has made
his principal military objective and which the valour
of the allied armies has victoriously defended against
unceasingly renewed offensives.</p>

<p>Permit me to see in your decision the homage of
all the nations that you represent toward a country
which more than any other has endured the sufferings
of war, of which entire provinces have been transformed
into a vast battle-field and have been systematically
laid waste by the invader, and which has
paid the human tribute in death. France has borne
these enormous sacrifices although she had not the
slightest responsibility for the frightful catastrophe
which has overwhelmed the universe, and at the
moment when the cycle of horror is ending, all the
powers whose delegates are assembled here may acquit
themselves of any share in the crime which has resulted
in such an unprecedented disaster. What gives you
the authority to establish a peace of justice is the fact
that none of the peoples of whom you are the delegates
has had any part in the injustice. Humanity can
place confidence in you because you are not among
those who have outraged the rights of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no need for further information or for
special inquiries into the origin of the drama which
has just shaken the world. The truth, bathed in
blood, has already escaped from the Imperial archives.
The premeditated character of the trap is to-day
clearly proved.</p>

<p>In the hope of conquering, first, the hegemony of
Europe, and next, the mastery of the world, the Central
Empires, bound together by a secret plot, found the
most abominable of pretexts for trying to crush Serbia
and force their way to the East. At the same time
they disowned the most solemn undertakings in order
to crush Belgium and force their way into the heart
of France.</p>

<p>These are the two unforgettable outrages which
opened the way to aggression. The combined efforts
of Great Britain, France, and Russia were exerted
against that man-made arrogance.</p>

<p>Your nations entered the war successively, but
came one and all to the help of threatened right.
Like Germany, Great Britain had guaranteed the independence
of Belgium. Germany sought to crush Belgium.
Great Britain and France both swore to save
her. Thus from the very beginning of hostilities there
came into conflict the two ideas which for fifty months
were to struggle for the domination of the world&mdash;the
idea of sovereign force, which accepts neither control
nor check, and the idea of justice, which depends on
the sword only to prevent or repress the abuse of
strength.</p>

<p>Faithfully supported by her dominions and colonies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Great Britain decided that she could not remain
aloof from a struggle in which the fate of every country
was involved. She has made, and her dominions
and colonies have made with her, prodigious efforts to
prevent the war from ending in a triumph for the
spirit of conquest and destruction of right.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>The intervention of the United States was something
more, something greater, than a great political
and military event. It was a supreme judgment
passed at the bar of history by the lofty conscience
of a free people, and their chief magistrate, on the
enormous responsibilities incurred in the frightful
conduct which was lacerating humanity. It was not
only to protect themselves from the audacious aims
of German megalomania that the United States
equipped fleets and created immense armies, but also,
and above all, to defend an ideal of liberty over which
they saw the huge shadow of the Imperial eagle
encroaching further every day.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>While the conflict was gradually extending over
the entire surface of the earth, the clanking of chains
was heard here and there, and captive nationalities
from the depths of their age-long jails, cried out to us
for help. Yet more, they escaped to come to our aid.
Poland came to life again; sent us troops. The
Czecho-Slovaks won their rights to independence in
Siberia, in France, in Italy. The Jugo-Slavs, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Armenians, the Syrians, and the Lebanese, the Arabs,
all oppressed peoples, all the victims long helpless or
resigned of great historic deeds of injustice, all the
martyrs of the past, all the outraged consciences, all
the strangled liberties, reviewed the clash of arms and
turned toward us as their natural defenders.</p>

<p>War gradually attained the fulness of its first
significance and became, in the fullest sense of the
term, a crusade of humanity for right; and if anything
can console us, in part at least, for the losses
we have suffered, it is assuredly the thought that our
victory is also the victory of right. This victory is
complete, for the enemy only asked for the armistice
to escape from an irretrievable military disaster. In
the interests of justice and peace, it now rests with
you to reap from this victory its full fruits.</p>

<p class='center'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
</p>

<p>By establishing this new order of things, you will
meet the aspirations of humanity, which, after the
frightful conclusions of the blood-stained years,
ardently wishes to free itself, protected by a union of
free peoples, against every possible revival of primitive
savagery. An immortal glory will attach to the names
of the nations and the men who have desired to
co-operate in this grand work of faith and brotherhood,
and who have taken the pains to eliminate from
the future peace causes of disturbance and instability.</p>

<p>This very day, forty-eight years ago&mdash;on the 18th
of January, 1871&mdash;the German Empire was proclaimed
by an army of invasion in the chateau at Versailles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
It was consecrated by the fate of two French provinces.
It was thus a violation from its origin and, by the fault
of its founders, it was born in injustice. It has ended
in oblivion.</p>

<p>You are assembled in order to repair the evil
that has been done, and to prevent a recurrence of it.
You hold in your hands the future of the world. I
leave you, gentlemen, to your grave deliberations, and
declare the Conference of Paris open.</p>
